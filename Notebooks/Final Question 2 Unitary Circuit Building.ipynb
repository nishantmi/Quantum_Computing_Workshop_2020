    "You may recall from your quantum mechanics course that quantum theory is unitary. The aim of a quantum computer essentially boils down to executing unitaries and as you have seen previously we also explored universality in quantum computing\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"A set of quantum gates is said to be universal if any unitary transformation of the quantum data can be efficiently approximated arbitrarily well as a sequence of gates in the set.\"** (https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/defining-quantum-circuits.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every gate you run on the IBM Quantum Experience is transpiled into single qubit rotations and CNOT (CX) gates. We know that these constitute a universal gate set, which implies that any unitary can be implemented using only these gates. However, in general it is not easy to find a good decomposition for an arbitrary unitary. Your task is to find such a decomposition for given unitary."
